        <p>Our goal is to help you learn how to play piano</p>

        <p>
          We have taken the building blocks of site reading music and put them into sets that allow for repeatable, feedback packed, ability matching learning</p>

        <p>
          Our passion for intentional practice is what is at the root of every set we challenge you with</p>

        <p>
          <b>Varied sets?</b> A key component of learning is providing your brain with varied practice so that you are constantly  engaged and thinking about what you are doing. This will be a more frustrating but in the long run will build deeper skills
